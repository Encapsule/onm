# onm/src/README

This directory contains onm's CoffeeScript implementation that is compiled to JavaScript at build-time (Grunt writes the output to onm/lib/*), and debugged and tested as such. If you're simply using onm, you can ignore this directory; the top-level package index.js file references the compiled JavaScript implementation in the onm/lib/* directory.
