# onm core CIDS subsystem

Class ID Subsystem (CIDS) implements onm core's class typing system that leverages a simple JavaScript object annotation protocol, strong unique identifiers, and normalized set/get functions, and an some in-memory look-up tables to affect generic type-based programming idioms in JavaScript.

Routines in the Native Type Conversion Library (NTCL) are available for wrapping native JavaScript and JSON types in CIDS compatible wrappers suitable for use as onm core request parameters.
