## v1.0 onm Test Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Encapsule/onm.svg?branch=chris%2Fv1.0-core-refactor)](https://travis-ci.org/Encapsule/onm)

## v0.2 onm Status

Currently, [onm v0.2 is published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onm). If you're using onm now, keep using v0.2. It's stable, and does what it does well.

If you're not already using onm, then odds are that even if you spend time here you're going to go away and BBN based on the docs... So, don't bother because onm is **changing** dramatically.

## v1.0 onm Status

[v1 Object Namespace Manager (onm)](./src/core/README.md) has been under development for several months. It's intended to power a new module called [Encapsule/jbus](https://github.com/Encapsule/jbus).

jbus will provide suitable replacements for onm v0.2 onm.Model, onm.Address, onm.Store, and onm.Namespace API objects that are (a) simpler to use (b) much more powerful than v0.2/v0.3 onm.

Please follow [EncapsuleTwitter]

[jbus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jbus),
and [jsgraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsgraph)-related Node.js package announcements.
